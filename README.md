# MRI-Soundscape

MRI Soundscape is an innovative project that explores the auditory environment of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems. By capturing and analyzing the sounds produced during MRI scans, this project aims to enhance patient comfort, provide insights into MRI machine operations, and contribute to the field of medical acoustics.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The primary goal of MRI Soundscape is to document and study the various sounds emitted by MRI machines during different scanning sequences. Understanding these acoustic patterns can lead to:

Improved patient experience by reducing anxiety associated with MRI procedures.

Development of noise reduction strategies for MRI machines.

Educational tools for medical professionals and patients.

Advancements in medical acoustics research.
